# I-m-Available---A-Vehicle-Sharing-Application

We can see that nowadays, people of the same organisation commute in a different-different ways,  even though their destination is same.
Two persons having the same or nearby drop-off location uses their own individual vehicles instead of a single vehicle. 
This creates needless use of the extra vehicle leading to more traffic and useless extra petrol cost.
